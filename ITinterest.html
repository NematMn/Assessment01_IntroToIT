	  <h1 style="font-family:verdana;"> My interest In IT:... </h1>
	   <p style="font-family:courier;">
	     The main interest in IT is the Networking Engineer.<br>
		 I also like Programming and Computer science.<br>
		 First time I used a computer was in high school when it was a subject to study,<br>
		 so, I bought one and since then I love the computer and I learned so quickly using it<br>
		 When I started a course at TAFE, I was the only girl in the class, I was surprised..<br>
		 but within time I used to that and it was interesting and had friends<br>
		 Unfortunately, I haven't worked yet so I don't have experience<br>
		 but Iam very excited to finish my Bachelor Degree and start my journey in IT<br>
		 and achieve my dream to complete my study and be a Professional Network Engineering<br>
		 especially, to be with Cisco.<br>
