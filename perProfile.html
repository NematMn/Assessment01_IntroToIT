    <br>	
		  My Primary Learning Style: <b>Pragmatist Style</b>
		  <p>
		  Pragmatists need to be able to see how to put the learning into practice in the real world.<br>
		  Abstract concepts and games are of limited use unless they can see a way to put the ideas <br>
		  into action. Pragmatists are likely to be experimenters, trying out new ideas,<br>
		  theories and techniques to see if they work.<br>
		  They may act quickly and confidently on ideas, getting straight to the point,<br>
		  and may lose patience with lengthy discussions.<br>
		<ul>
		 Learning methods suited to pragmatists learner:
		    <li> Practicals</li>
			<li> Case Studies</li>
			<li> Problem Setting</li>
			<li> Discussions</li>
		</ul>
		
		My Secondary learning Style: <b>Activity Style</b>
		<p>
		Activists like to immerse themselves fully in new experiences. <br>
		They enjoy the ‘here and now’, and tend to be open minded, <br>
		enthusiastic and flexible. They have a tendency to act first and consider<br>
		the consequences later, and they often seek to centre activities around themselves.<br>
		
		<ul>
		Learning methods suited to activits learner:
		 <li> Brainstorming</li>
		 <li> Problem Setting</li>
		 <li> Group Discussion</li>
		 <li> Roleplaying</li>
		</ul>
		
		My Tertiary Learning Style: <b>Reflector Style</b>
		<p>
		Reflectors prefer to stand back and observe. They tend to be cautious,<br>
		preferring to take a back seat.<br>
		They like to collect and analyse information to help them reach their conclusions,<br>
		which they may take considerable time and effort to develop.<br>
		Reflectors see the big picture by using information gathered from previous experience<br>
		as well as the here and now.<br>
		
		<ul>
		Learning methods suited to reflectors learner:
		 <li> Paired Discussions</li>
		 <li> Self analysis questionnaires</li>
		 <li> Time out</li>
		 <li> Showcase/ Demonstrations</li>
		 <li> feedback from others</li>
		 <li> Coaching</li>
		</ul>
		
		My Quaternary Learning Style: <b>Theorist Style</b>
		<p>
		Theorists like to think through problems in a logical manner. They value rationality and objectivity,<br>
		and like to assimilate disparate facts into coherent theories.<br>
		They are disciplined, aiming to fit things into a rational order.<br>
		They are often keen on basic assumptions, principles, theories, models and systems thinking.<br>
		
		<ul>
		Learning methods suited to theorists learner:
		 <li> Models</li>
		 <li> Classroom Response Systems</li>
		 <li> Story-Telling</li>
		 <li> Quotes</li>

	  	<img src="LeadershipStyle.png" width="550" height="400">
		<br>
		Distinctive features of Postmodern Leadership:
		<ul>
		 <li> Can emerge from anywhere, inside or outside the group that is led.</li>
         <li>Is a discrete act, not an ongoing role.</li>
         <li>Is an influence process that ends once followers act.</li>
         <li>Does not manage people or make decisions for them.</li>
         <li>Can be shown by groups to other groups, not just by individuals.</li>
         <li>Fluid, not dominating, as no one has a monopoly on good ideas.</li>
		</ul>
