	<h1> My Project Idea:.. </h1>
	 <p style="font-family:courier;">
	  <b>Overview:</b> Fingerprint Based Voting System, is a project that is implemented<br>
	  with the biometric system; i.e: fingerprint scanning.<br>
	  Since the finger pattern is unique for each person, the voter can easily authenticated<br>
	  It enhances the accuracy and speed of the process<br>
	  This project is also accurate, transparent, and faster and will ensure a single vote for a single person<br>
	  <br>
	  
	  <b>Motivation:</b> After the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions<br>
         that have been imposed and prevent the gatherings of people and social distancing<br>
         etc..In addition to unknown destiny when will get out of this pandemic,<br>
         so it will be necessary trying to continue our live as much as we can,<br>
         take into consideration the safety rules.<br>
         Thus, to avoid all these gatherings that will happen at the elections centre,<br>
         this project idea will be useful to keep everyone safe and continue to vote without<br>
         any harm or infection.<br>
		 Even after the pandemic over, this idea will be saving more time.<br>
		 <br>
		 
	  <b>Description:</b> The project idea's system will allow the user to vote one time for a particular<br>
	     election. It also will allow the user to vote for one candidates<br>
		 The system will recognize the user by his fingerprint so it will uniquely identified<br>
		 The features for this project:
		 <ul>
		  <li>Registration: This feature allow the user to sign up and register to the system</li>
		  <li>Login: This feature will enable the user to login to the system<br>
		      by enter their ID and password</li>
		  <li>Fingerprint Vertification: This will allow for the authenticated user to vote<br>
		      for a cndidate for one time by their uniquely fingerprint</li>
          <li>View Result: The user can view the election result by using the election id</li><br>
		  </ul>
		  <br>
		 
		 <p style="font-family:courier;">
	  <b>Tools and Technologies:</b> For Software, would need for Windows Version, it can be from 7 to 10<br>
         We can use SQL Language and Visual Studio.<br>	 
		 For the Hardware, fingerprint module, LCD display and ARM processor<br>
	  <br>
	  
	  <b>Skills Required:</b> It required to have experience with Windows, SQL language<br>
	     have skills with the hardware as well.<br>
	  <br>
